# Termbox Console
### An implementation of the [`console_draw`](https://github.com/TyOverby/console_draw) API using the termbox backend.

If you are thinking of using ncurses, but all you really need is the ability to
draw arbitrary chars or strings to the console, then Termbox Console will fit your needs
perfectly!
